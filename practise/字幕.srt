00:00:03,433-->00:00:06,433
Goal of the United Nations aims to 

2
00:00:06,433-->00:00:09,433
ensure global sustainable access to 

3
00:00:09,433-->00:00:12,433
modern, reliable, affordable and 

4
00:00:12,433-->00:00:15,433
clean energy. The lack of sustainable,

5
00:00:15,433-->00:00:18,433
 reliable and secure energy services is 

6
00:00:18,433-->00:00:21,433
a serious challenge globally. 

7
00:00:21,433-->00:00:24,433
Achieving this goal requires 

8
00:00:24,433-->00:00:27,433
providing renewable energy, 

9
00:00:27,433-->00:00:30,433
improving energy efficiency and 

10
00:00:30,433-->00:00:33,433
promoting clean energy technology.

11
00:00:33,433-->00:00:36,433
China is the largest wind power market 

12
00:00:36,433-->00:00:39,433
in the world, with a wind power installed capacity 

13
00:00:39,433-->00:00:42,433
of 210 GW in 2019, 

14
00:00:42,433-->00:00:45,433
accounting for 35% of global capacity. 

15
00:00:45,433-->00:00:48,433
The Chinese government has vigorously promoted 

16
00:00:48,433-->00:00:51,433
renewable energy and has become the world's 

17
00:00:51,433-->00:00:54,433
largest producer of solar and wind energy.

18
00:00:54,433-->00:00:57,433
The government has taken a series of measures, 

19
00:00:57,433-->00:01:00,433
such as implementing clean energy policies and 

20
00:01:00,433-->00:01:03,433
providing tax breaks, 

21
00:01:03,433-->00:01:06,433
to encourage the development of renewable energy.

22
00:01:06,433-->00:01:09,433
However, the development of clean energy also 

23
00:01:09,433-->00:01:12,433
faces some challenges. The instability of 

24
00:01:12,433-->00:01:15,433
renewable energy and how to solve energy storage 

25
00:01:15,433-->00:01:18,433
and distribution problems 

26
00:01:18,433-->00:01:21,433
are still difficult problems. 

27
00:01:21,433-->00:01:24,433
Traditional energy is cheap and 

28
00:01:24,433-->00:01:27,433
has a high usage rate, and many people 

29
00:01:27,433-->00:01:30,433
still use non-clean energy.

30
00:01:30,433-->00:01:33,433
To overcome these challenges, 

31
00:01:33,433-->00:01:36,433
the Chinese government has taken measures 

32
00:01:36,433-->00:01:39,433
such as increasing investment and 

33
00:01:39,433-->00:01:42,433
research and development 

34
00:01:42,433-->00:01:45,433
in energy storage technology to solve 

35
00:01:45,433-->00:01:48,433
the instability of renewable energy.

36
00:01:48,433-->00:01:51,433
 The government is also strengthening 

37
00:01:51,433-->00:01:54,433
the promotion and education of 

38
00:01:54,433-->00:01:57,433
clean energy to improve public awareness 

39
00:01:57,433-->00:02:00,433
and acceptance.

40
00:02:00,433-->00:02:03,433
China has already achieved some 

41
00:02:03,433-->00:02:06,433
successful cases in clean energy. 

42
00:02:06,433-->00:02:09,433
For example, in 2019, renewable energy 

43
00:02:09,433-->00:02:12,433
accounted for 28.2% of total 

44
00:02:12,433-->00:02:15,433
electricity consumption, 

45
00:02:15,433-->00:02:18,433
far exceeding the UN's target. 

46
00:02:18,433-->00:02:21,433
In addition, China has established 

47
00:02:21,433-->00:02:24,433
the world's largest wind and 

48
00:02:24,433-->00:02:27,433
solar power station, contributing to 

49
00:02:27,433-->00:02:30,433
the development of global clean energy.

50
00:02:30,433-->00:02:33,433
Achieving the 7th Sustainable Development Goal of 

51
00:02:33,433-->00:02:36,433
the United Nations requires global cooperation 

52
00:02:36,433-->00:02:39,433
and coordination, as well as the support and 

53
00:02:39,433-->00:02:42,433
efforts of governments and the public in 

54
00:02:42,433-->00:02:45,433
various countries. 

55
00:02:45,433-->00:02:48,433
By strengthening policy and technical support 

56
00:02:48,433-->00:02:51,433
and improving public awareness and 

57
00:02:51,433-->00:02:54,433
acceptance of clean energy, 

58
00:02:54,433-->00:02:57,433
we can jointly achieve the goal of 

59
00:02:57,433-->00:03:00,433
global sustainable energy.
